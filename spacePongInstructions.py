11. Set a Time Limit:
   - Decide how long the game will last, like 1 minute or 2 minutes.

12. End the Game:
    - If the laser beam goes off the screen, it's a missed shot.
    - If you run out of time, the game ends too.
    - Show a message saying "Game Over" with your final score.

13. Make It Fun:
    - You can add cool sound effects when you hit targets or bounce the laser beam.
    - Try to hit as many targets as possible to get a high score!
    - You can also change the game to make it easier or more challenging.

Remember to have fun and be creative! You can make your spaceship paddle look unique, draw funny targets, or add power-ups if you like. The more you practice, the better your game-making skills will get! Enjoy playing your Space Pong game!
